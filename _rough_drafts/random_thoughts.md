...not for nothing, woke up today with some thoughts about the work I've been doing here lately. and it seems like the work with the API was actually a fairly big thing I was hoping to be able to do. 

I don't know why, but it seems like it was important to me. To be able to sort of "slay that dragon" so to speak. 

And so, the question is: now what? 

I mean, being able to create this web app is sort of something that I've been chasing for a little while, but unlocking the "magic" of how it's done was also something that I wanted to be able to do.

And now I find that I feel as though i'm almost through. 

Not with learning, but with the Odin Project. Like, I feel like I understand the curriculum more, that I understand the technology that's being promoted, and that I understand a lot about the different parts of Rails the framework and the underlying languages as well. 

But there's still a lot of work to be done. 

Just because I feel comfortable with the software doesn't necessarily mean I've created anything. 

Having the tools is one thing, but being able to use them to build is another. 

And I think this is a good allegory to my life at this point. I have a lot of tools at my disposal, yet I don't have a lot of maintained ideas to really show for it. 

I mean, I think one of the things that I want to acknowledge is the idea that I'v often wanted a blog; A platform to sort of produce. And part of the "want" is maintaining the work that is done. I can type and I can write almost without qualm, and that's not a problem. The idea of re-visiting what I've already written though is another issue altogether. 

When I was studying music, what would I do? I'd return to a piece of music frequently. And I'd learn it. And there was no problem with that at all. Why is it any different to be learning about how to maintain something that I produce? 

Perhaps because the topic isn't as interesting to me? I think that's damning. If something is interesting to me, it's interesting. Why not dig into it a little more. 

For example, all these different parts about learning how to program, such as testing, or designing, or making HTTP requests...these things are interesting to me, but then again so is the idea of a "toy" like Jekyll. But then I'm confronted with some other issues, such as one template not necessarily matching 100% with another template. And those are just a couple issues that if I took the time to understand them, would probably be solved relatively quickly. 

So to that end, I think that there are always different things that I can work on. Or different things that I can work with. 

So take the time and do that. lol.
