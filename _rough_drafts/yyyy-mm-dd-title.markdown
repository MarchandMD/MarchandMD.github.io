## Intro
This is a high-level overview of an HTTP request making it's way from start to finish, through an app built in Rails. Knowing all the diferent parts of a Rails app makes the visualization of an HTTP request easier to observe. Since this is the basic flow of the typical usage of the internet for casual end users, having a firm understanding of the ideas below really helps to paint a picture. 

## paragraph 1

The starting point is an HTTP request. End users rarely compose an actual HTTP request, however, every time a web address is typed in a browser address bar, or anytime a link is clicked, an HTTP request is being composed and sent to a server. An HTTP request is, generally speaking, a request by a client to a server for a specific piece of information, data or some other resource. Since everything on the internet is a document or file, everything has a specific location and or address that can be accessed. As long as you know the address of whatever you're looking for, you'll be able to find it. Certain things you don't need to know; Such as the actual location of an image file, or the actual location of other media. But that's ok, as long as the application has been built sufficiently well, typing in a web address is good enough to get a complete web page displayed on the browser. 

The HTTP request is like a piece of snail mail being sent via the USPS. Or like a package being delivered by amazon.
