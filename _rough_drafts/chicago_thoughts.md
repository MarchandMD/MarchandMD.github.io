just a couple thoughts to gather myself before moving onto the next adventure. 

Most of this should be familiar to me. I think that there's a lot of comfort in what I see and what I know. I think I know what I have to do; 

I mean, the next adventure is to find the cta card and get my ass onto the train, and then get to the next stop. But what's the next stop? 

I think the next thing to do is to get to the hotel and see if I can dro off myself until check in. 

And then after that, what would I be doing? 

Then I'd be totally on my own to do whatever; I'd really like to drop off the stuff and then keep the bag so I can pack the laptop and the camera, and then go from there. But if I'm wtihout that's fine. 

I can do the cultural center. The library. the old neighborhood and then the coffee shop. 

Train, hotel. cultural center. coffee shop. 

Alright; got to the hotel; booked a thing. Was gonna do the cultural center; but I think I'm too hungry for that; or at leates I know now taht I need to eat something first; but I've been on the move for a hot  second, so I need to cool down for a minute and then take it from there. 

What could I do now? 

Ok, so since I need to just spend a little bit of time here, I'm going to just look at what Ive done for the website; 

I mean the article that I'm working on is the section of the odin project that deals with routes. 

that's really it. And I've done a lot of it; I can't really get much mroe out of the actual odin section itself; so I should probably focus on doing something from the acctual guide for rails. Which is the thrust of the article. 

Ok. What else though about being here? 

It really jsut feels like I've commuted somewhere locally; It doesn't feel like it's across the country; and I think that comes from perhaps limiting the amount of things that I do in life; I mean, I work constantly in this IDE. And so now I'm in Chicago, but I can't go balls to the wall for the entire time I'm here; I need to have some respect for what I'm doing. I mean, I can see all the sights etc. But then again, I still need to take care of myself. And plan my day. Or the rest of htis day. So yeah. 

So today, what I want to do is go up to bourgeois pig. And just hang out for a hot second; wlak through that neighborhood and just to a circle of Lincoln Ave and the university. Ok. Hunger acting up. Gotta move. 

Maybe art institute this afternoon? 

Maybe; i think the thing I really needs is that nap. 

But for now just a little bit of food and some comfort while it's rainy; And I don't know if I've actually sen many caps in the streets; not that I've bee looking for a lot of them. But it definitely seems like there's a lot fewer of them. 

So if that's the case that's fine; it allows me a chance to use of the other services in the city. 

alright so, now, maybe spend some time doing some work on the rails site. well, or, I can try to build another thing from scratch; but really 

Alright, so since this is all really random...I mean, yeah it does feel fresh, but at the same time it feels familiar; I mean, what can I do while I'm here? 

Really the point wasn't ever supposed to be anything other than walk around and snap photos and eat food; I mean, I've done the difficult part of things. Right? 

and so then what would I like to plan? what can I plan? 

so tomorrow is friday; and I don't necessarily want to be part of the rush at all; I wonder if there are still honor boxes for chicgo reader around the city. 

Umm, so what else. 

I mean, i think I can rule out actually viewing places as a potential buyer. That's not possible; So then after the evening tonight...well, I want some food; and I dont know when or how I'd get food; I suppose I could order some to the room? I mean, It'd be nice to get some while out, but that's sort of out of the question. 

Oh, I guess I could slow down and look at some of the previous articles....

alright so, yeah, there are some other thoughts that sort of come up; Like, I've only just begun to build some sort of community; but there's a reason taht I've begun to do that; I mean, I've been in Boulder for roughly the same amount of time; So if I were to do something big...when? It wouldn't be before I finish Turing. 

And I am going to do Turing. I just don't know why or when I'd do it, because right now, I am completly alright wiht doing the mortgage thing; And then the school will happen when the school happens. But I've been telling everyone that it's going to happen sometime in January 2022; My resersvation about that is, if I do that it'll be wrapped up in about July...provided I don't have to repeat anything; but I've begun looking at it and I tthink that I most likely won't have to repeat it. But I guess i'm not sure fi i will or won't and what I don't want to do is I don't want to have to renew the lease when I don't want to renew the lease. So that means I'd push the start to a later date? 

It's intresting that doing this here, and thinking about the rest of things is taking the conversation to a much larger topic. And that's my hesitation for committing to Turing in January. Because I don't want to be faced with the ending of the lease. 

So then, what would I do? 

I think I'd have to sub-lease my current place, and find another place to rent? 

Or the other thing I suppose would be I could buy, and move in, and then start Turing. but I don' tnecssarily wnt to leave the Seasons right now. 

# Day 2

Good morning now. time to strat the second day; but of course efor I start I'm going to reviewt what I did yesterday; and I did a lot; I mean, most of the day was spent here in the city. And so I now know what it feels like to spend close to a full 24 hours here; 

It's remarkable in that it does go by so quickly. But of course there's  lot of stuff that I did. I mean, I was walking around, then I was visiting things; and then I was planning, and then I was just sort of seeing things. 

But a lot of the time I did feel idle. 

But I did go to a show; which I was actually really proud of. I feel like that's me not repeating myself. 

and I feel something else familiar....This experience of writing....when one idea I have, could grow and grow to other ideas. And that anything I say is only the beginning of something. Like, just by being alive there's a cultivation that occurs. or that is happening. Like, I find that with my ideas and my words what I'm doing is trying to find the bare minimum of coherence to express myself, when re-reading any of these idea's I've written allows my brain to flourish into infinite other trains of thought. 

that's a feeling that Boulder just doesn't give me. 

It's not that Boulder DOESN'T do that; Or it's not that I couldn't experience it while in Boulder; It's more that being in the city simply means I'm going to experience more of this "a written idea will, upon re-reading, lead to other ideas".... Like, the pace of life in Boulder is just different. 

Not bad; just different. 

But back to this idea about moving to Chicago; I may want to, but I don't want to be impetuous about it. I mean, i have $5k being granted to me if I stay in boulder and do the Turing thing. 

Next, I am saying I don't want to start because I don't want to finish around the same time as the end of my lease. Which seems like a foolish thing to do...to just not start. What I should be doing is....ask my landlord's if they'd be willing to switch to month to month. Or extend the lease month to month. I think that's something that I should look at. Since I don't necessarily want to move. Theres all these things to think about. But for now, why not go grab the food, then maybe...what? Go up to Lincoln Park? I need to think about...what if I can't necessarily eat it there? Because If I remember, I never just ate the stuff there. So then, where would I take it? I mean, I can't necessarily just go somewhere else and it eat, can I? 

## post art institute and Kozy's noodles and rice and chicago dog
alright so it's absolutely beautiful being in chicago; Like, it's just nice to be hear. 

But I would love to actually live here, if just for the stuff to do; 

but again, sort of like I was saying earlier, it's one thing to just be able to enjoy all these things; it's another to actually be vested in my own life; 

Like, I don't know how to describe my time here; Like, I think i'm so in love with this place now, and have been; but I'm such a different guy than I was then when I left this place. 

But I've learned some things...

I feel like I was such a baby the first time I was here. Like, I spent a lot of time here, and I had no money, and I had to responsibility....Like, I don't know how I survived; and I almost haven't. 

perhaps it's dangerous; to feel so comfortable; Like, I begin to feel like i deserve companionship; it's not that I don't, ut I don't deserve to be alone. 

Honestly, I could probably travel here, and stay for a week, and the office would never know. so long as I continue to do the work.
