## Intro
The next "idea" i'm about to explore are ActiveRecord associations. Though I'm a little confused as to why I would even be learning about associations right now. I just learned about Models, and validations....but I have barely used them at all. 

Before learning how to simplify Models, shouldn't I know how to use Models? Being shown how to make something easy doesn't necessarily benefit me, if I don't know how it's making something easier.

Perhaps this is more of a philosophical argument: I must struggle before I can appreciate an advantage. 

Then again, perhaps this isn't a philosophical argument, but rather an admission that I don't know how to work with a single Model. 

And if this is the case, then shouldn't my efforts be returned to gaining comfort with Models? 

And since my desire is to have finished products/projects that are complete, wouldn't it be a good idea to create a project that uses a single Model? And demonstrates fluency and competency with interacting with a Model? Yes. It would. And It could create articles as well.
