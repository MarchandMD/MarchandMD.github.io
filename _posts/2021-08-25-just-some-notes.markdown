Started the timer, am committed to these next 25 minutes. Not really that much time to spend. So what do i really want to do? I mean, I think I just want to get some words down on the page, so to speak. It's been a while since I really wrote in a meaningful way. At least a meaningful way to myself. What have I been doing more of lately? Planning? I guess. fantasizing? Perhaps. My fantasies these days are more about the type of person I could become though, and less about becoming an astronaut. Like, I think I fantasize about having motivation. Which is a pleasant fantasy to have. Though what would be more pleasant would be to act on the fantasy.  

What would be even more pleasurable than that would be to re-gain some mobility. Some freedom, I suppose. Being so concerned about the injury is exceptionally prohibitive. 

Though there has been some positive's which have come during this period of time: i won't balloon out if i'm less active. 

I can still survive without being so focused on prepping full meals.  

Meditation is still an important part of life.  

If I had my health, what would I do?  

sand that desk. Buy a couch. camp. go to other appointments. 

Ok, this is enough. 

The real reason I've been writing is I wanted some excuse to create a new post, and see it go "live", at least in development. Adn then write a litlte mroe about how to use Jekyll. 

Because it looks like Jekyll will do a lot for me. But instead of just doing that, instead of just plugging in a theme, I'd like to know a little bit more about it. just understand the basics so i can explore a little bit, and really see what's happening when I start to build more. 

## it really do be that fast
Wow, this is incredibly fast, and fun. Which makes it enjoyable. And I want to do it more. I want to learn more about it, and become more capable with it. 

And since there are all these other things, maybe I could even build something that I'd be comfortable pushing to Github. 

So there's that. Ok. 

so yeah. And really, these articles are just articles that I can plug and play with. 

## So what to learn next? 

I think the thing to do is to always return to [the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

Because obviously that's what's driving the production/learning. 

So remember, I'm doing all this through a markdown page; but there is something that's important that's happening; and it's happening at the top of the page...or as they call it, the front of the page. And that's called FrontMatter. 

But before that, they talk about pages and posts. 

And even though those sections are small, there's still important information there. 

## Pages
info found [here, on jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)

The docs say that pages are:

> ...useful for standalone content (content which is not date based or is not a group of content such as staff members or recipes). 

this begs the question: what is good for staff members or recipes? But answering that isn't really something I want to dwell on right now. 

Rather, it seems that `pages` would be like an entire webpage.... for a certain "type" of static information. Information that's relevant, but doesn't necessarily need to be dependent upon time. 

See, it's difficult because this is a new subject and my brain just wants to absorb it all, but I know the only way to really absorb it is by being involved and spending time with it. 

I know how to do that....

Ok, so one part of Jekyll is the idea of `Pages`. Some examples would be: 

1. About
2. Contact
3. Home

that makes sense. 

### How to add a new `page` to my site

simply add a `.html` page to the root directory. That's it. 

Well, that's not really it. But that's the starting point. 

So I can make my site as simple or as complex as I'd like, with the quantity of pages I give it. And I can give it additional pages by simply adding a `.html` file to the root directory. 

Easy peasy. 

I have options though. AS is true with most technology. I could write the page in markdown, using the `.md` file extension to take care of things. 

### how to organize when I have lots of `pages`

I can create directories in the root directory; then store `pages` in those root directories.  

Any additional directories I make in the root directory will exist in the `_site` directory when the site is built. Not really sure the significance of this piece of information, but so be it. 

the next bit about "when a page has a different _permalink_..." is some jazz that isn't really intuitive to me. But it is noted here, so it may be worth learning about. `Permalinks` have their own section, so I'll come back to this section later. 

### Changing the output URL...

While this seems like an interesting idea, it's very low on my priority list or MVP need list...

### excerpts

again, something I don't really care about right now....  

## Conclusion about `Pages`

So i think I go the basics; When building a website, it will have webpages. Depending on what's on that webpage, i'll create that page by creating a `.html` file (or possibly a `.md` file); and that'll be the general way things are created/organized. One thing I may want to do next is go ahead and take a look at one of those "pages" now...

### real world example
So, looking at the first site built, I notice that the only `.html` files in the root directory are: 

- `404.html`
- `photos.html` (which I created)

That's not to say there aren't other files in other places, though those are the only two at the root level. 

Now, there is a `_site` sub-directory, and that has an `index.html` in it...but there's a little more going on. But for now, I know that's generally where things are. 

Now, I have some quesitons for sure. My next questions are about both the templating that's happening, and also about the directory structure. 

Because what I'm seeing is that directory structure is a little different than what they've told me it would be. 

So I really want to dig a little more into that, before I start digging into some other things, like getitng creative with design, etc. 

But I do want to expand. and I do want to test my boundaries a little.
