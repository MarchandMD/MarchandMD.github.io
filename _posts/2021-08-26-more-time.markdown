More than anything, i want to write freely; but of course I'm always so concerned about my identity, and things coming back to me.  

But if that's an issue, why not just assume an identity. Jonas Throe. 

Alright; so I've decided to make a change; I'm going to assume a different name for this; This may allow me to write unfettered. And not worry to much about what I put out there. This way I can be as personal as I want to be. 

So now, to figure out where to change the name....

that was easy; Did it in the config file. 

Ok, then now what?  

Do I want to look at the....I do want to add some stylings. Not much; just some small things. 

So i'll see if I can figure that out. 

ok, so the `_site` file is generated; and it doesn't necessarily have any power. 

alright, so this is the interesting bit; I need to figure out where the templates are for my page; Like, i know they're here somewhere; just gotta find them. 

I know there are layouts in the gem....
