### introduction
There are blogs for all types of subjects. When an idea for a blog article comes along it would be helpful to quickly turn that idea into an actual blog post. This article exists to reinforce the idea that **writing a blog article is easy with Jekyll!** 

At it's core, generally speaking Jekyll is nothing more than a Gem. However, the folks who have built Jekyll refer to the software as a 'static site generator'. After generating a static site -- following the [quick start instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/#instructions){:target="_blank"}  on their homepage -- it is a short leap to writing blog articles. 
 
With any software, there are some basic 'rules'. These 'rules' must be respected for the software to work properly. This blog post discusses the following rules for making a blog post/article appear when using Jekyll: 

1. how to name the file 
2. adding front matter YAML to the file
3. using markdown for the content 
4. where to place the file within the blog/project directory 

If you're familiar with Ruby, Gems, and markdown, this will seem like child's play! **Writing a blog article is easy with Jekyll in our "toolbelt"!**

### body of article
#### proper file name format
With the first static site generated using Jekyll, the first thing to do is to create a markdown file. You have been writing all your self-study notes in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){:target="_blank"}, right? Right?! ðŸ¤ª  


Creating a new markdown file is as simple as creating a new file with the extension of `.md` or `.markdown`. **The file needs to follow this specific format when naming: `yyyy-mm-dd-title.markdown`.** Jekyll will use the file name to populate the date the article was written, and the default title of the article. Examples of a proper format: 

- `2021-01-01-my-first-article.markdown`
- `1969-06-09-nice.md`

If this format is *not* followed, the article will simply not appear when the blog is served or published locally or on the web. The file will still appear in your directory, but Jekyll will ignore the file. An author can ignore this convention if the desire is to avoid publishing an article, but there are other ways to prevent an article from being published temporarily or permanently. One of those ways is with front matter.  

#### adding front matter
Now that a blank markdown file has been created and properly named, the next part of a blog article is [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/){:target="_blank"}. Front matter is a block of code, written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/){:target="_blank"}, that helps Jekyll format blog posts. With front matter it's possible to set and call variables, both global and page-specific. Some of the variables that can be used in front matter are:

 - `title`
 - `layout`
 - `published`
 - `permalink`
 - `date`
 - `category/categories`
 - `tags  `
  
  Here's a screen shot of example front matter: 

![whatever](/assets/images/front_matter.png)

Using three dashed lines `---` the YAML block begins and ends.  

Earlier in the article was a suggestion for intentionally mislabelling a file to prevent an article from being published; However, by including the `published: false` front matter Jekyll will ignore this file. When the file is ready for the general public, simply change the value from `false` to `true` and Jekyll will reveal the article.  

The most important of these variables, for the sake of this article, is the `layout` variable. The simplest thing to do would be to use `default`; However, with the theme installed for my current blog, `post` is a pseudonym for `default`. The [official documentation has plenty of discussion for layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/){:target="_blank"}. With a markdown file created and front matter added, the next step is to actually write the article with markdown.  

#### writing the article with markdown
YAML is a tool for setting up the file, just like markdown is a tool for writing content. 

I like to think of markdown as taking the entirety of Microsoft Word and getting rid of all the stuff you don't really need, and keeping the rest of it in the form of simple syntax rules. The idea of creating headings in the text, lists and links, as well as text decorations is made very simple with a few commands.  

If markdown isn't a familiar tool yet, I suggest taking notes in markdown on the computer. Doing this is a great way to learn while using the tool. Taking organized notes is a great way to process new information, and markdown makes it easy. With a Jekyll-built blog, content is written with markdown, making blog posts even easier to quickly compose.  

#### where to place the blog post with the directory
One thing that was never expressed was exactly *where* to create the markdown file. Jekyll comes with a pre-determined file directory. This directory is like a "framework" of how the project should be structured.  

One of the sub-folders/subdirectories is called `_posts`. And if there were any doubts about where to save the blog posts, the title of this subdirectory should settle that ambiguity! The `_posts` directory is where all posts should be stored. Feel free to [read more about posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/){:target="_blank"} on the official website for Jekyll. 

### conclusion
Using the few rules discussed here, it can be easy to properly compose a blog post for a Jekyll powered site. Following the proper format for a file name ensures Jekyll will be able to identify the date and default title of an article. Adding front matter in YAML using a few pre-determined variables helps to format and display the article correctly. And writing the article itself is made easier with markdown. Finally, using the pre-determined directory structure generated by Jekyll ensures the file is stored in the proper location. With blog posts being so easy to write in a Jekyll-built blog there are few excuses for *not* writing blog articles; All that is required at this point is some of your own inspiration! So get writing! And share your ideas with the world!
