# introduction
How to set up GraphQL in an API-only rails app

This is a reminder of how to setup an API-only Rails app as part of a Service-Oriented Architecture to operate as a microservice consuming a 3rd party API and receiving graphQL queries and mutations.

# requirements

Minimally, you'll need an API-only Rails app started.

No database is needed for this tutorial. However, since rails will include one when creating a new project, and because I'll want to keep working on this project on my own, I'm going to include a postgresQL database.

If you'd like to follow along completely from scratch, you can setup an API-only Rails app with the following command

```
rails new nhlapi-graphql -d postgresql -T --api-only
```

Now I'll `cd` into the project directory and make the initial commit

```
cd nhlapi-graphql
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

Now we have an api-only rails app ready to start being customized. Let's start by adding the necessary gems.

# gems

There's really only one gem needed, and that's the `graphql` gem.

Since I'm relatively new to graphQL, i'm going to also install `graphiql-rails`, which simply provides a handy browser interface for testing the graphQL queries in the development environment.

Let's install the gems one at a time directly from the command line (if you're using `bundler`)

```
bundle add graphql
```

and then

```
bundle add graphiql-rails
```

I'm also going to add the `rspec-rails` gem as well, since i'll be using `RSpec` to test in future articles.

```
bundle add rspec-rails
```

Now that both of these gems are in the gemfile don't forget to `bundle` to update the `Gemfile.lock`.

# setup

Now that the app has been scaffolded, and the necessary gems have been added, it's time to install the necessary components around the file to be able to test and use GraphQL.

First, let's install the necessary `rspec` parts:

```
rails g rspec:install
```

This will add the following files:

1. `.rspec`
2. `spec/spec_helper.rb`
3. `spec/rails_helper.rb`

Finally, let's install the necessary `graphql` parts:

```
rails g graphql:install
```

This will add a lot more stuff to the `app/` directory. But don't worry, most of it is boilerplate that doesn't necessarily require a deep, deep understanding. The necessary parts will be discussed in future articles.

The one really neat thing this does though is adds some very cool info to the `config/routes.rb` file. It looks like this:

```ruby
if Rails.env.development?
    mount GraphiQL::Rails::Engine, at: "/graphiql", graphql_path: "/graphql"
  end
  post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
```

This is graphQL using the `graphiql-rails` gem. Essentially what I believe this is doing is: if the Rails app is running in the development enviornment, start GraphiQL and make it available via the `/graphiql` web address, and then point any requests that come to it to the `/graphql` route.

The last line shows `post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"` which should be familiar to you.


# conclusion
This may seem like a lot, but it's just scratching the surface. Next up is an article on GraphQL `Types` and how they're related to ActiveRecord `Model` objects.
