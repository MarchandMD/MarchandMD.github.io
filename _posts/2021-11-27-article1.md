title: "It's easy to write a blog article in Jekyll!"
---

Alright, learning to work with Jekyll....it's a template language, but there's still a learning curve. So just like I was thinking earlier today, the point I want to emphasize here is that I do want to write some more articles, but I want to have a purpose and I want to have a goal. So what should be the thrust of the first article under this new direction? 

- how much of a process do I want to incorporate? 
- What's the point of the article? 
- How long with this article be? 
- What do I want to do between start and finish?  
- What type of articles am I writing? Expository

# Introduction
- hook
- topic sentence
- 3 main ideas to be explained in body

# Body
- 3 or more fully developed paragraphs (one paragraph to support each main idea)
- Each paragraph should have a topic sentence and 4 - 5 sentences supporting the topic sentence
- Transition words and phrases

# Conclusion
- Bring closure
- Briefly restate 3 main ideas
- May end with strong statement or an appeal to the emotions

So, with a structure in place, the next thing I need to do is really identify what exactly the topic is, and the main idea. 

Possible thesis topics: 
- Writing an article in Jekyll  
- Setting up an article in Jekyll
- Using markdown language to write an article in Jekyll
- Writing a blog article in markdown with Jekyll
- Using markdown and Jekyll to write an article for the blog in the correct format
- Formatting a markdown file for blog written in Jekyll

well, I think it's clear I don't fully understand what exactly the idea is; But that's ok, don't let that stop you. maybe writing the rest of the article will make it a little clearer. 

Topic sentence, or....yeah, no need to turn this into something super complicated. KISS

Thesis statement: 
* Writing an article for my blog is easy, when the blog is written with Jekyll. 

Main ideas: 
- It's written in markdown, with some basic styling rules
- It's saved in a certain place within the directory
- It's file name needs to be a certain format

Conclusion: 
If the main ideas are completed appropriately, then the article will appear in the blog. So yes: writing an article for my blog is easy, when the blog is written with Jekyll. 

Ok, so maybe I have the outline. Now I need to rough draft. 

But don't try to type it up. Actually handwrite the article.
