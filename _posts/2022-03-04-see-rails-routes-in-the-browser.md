Instead of continuing to forgot how to do this, i'm going to write a quick article that'll hopefully make this shortcut stick.  

There's a really handy shortcut to looking at the routes available when developing a Rails app. 

In the browser address bar, if I just tack on `/rails/info/routes` i'll get all the routes right there in the browser; 10x more readable than in the console. 

![routes](/assets/images/routes.jpg)

There, hopefully `/rails/info/routes` will now stick in my brain! lol. And again, just to make sure I remember the command, it's `/rails/info/routes`. Sort of like RoR, but RiR lol. Maybe that'll do the trick. Something handy to trick my brain into firing. RiR. Rails, info, routes. and then just turn that into `/rails/info/routes`

That should stick now. 

`/rails/info/routes`
