Since 2018 I've been gradually building momentum, and projects. Starting from knowing absolutely nothing about programming, i've included a couple of Gems that I've built in this section.

# Projects completed through self-directed study:
- The blog/website you're looking at right now
- [Predict-the-game](http://predict-the-game.herokuapp.com) - Fully deployed web application built with a Service-Oriented Architecture, using Oauth for user authentication, sessions for authorization, and Ruby on Rails
- [Hangman Gem](#hangman-gem) - Ruby commandline game built as a Gem
- [Mastermind](#mastermind) - Ruby commandline game
- [Declarative Tic Tac Toe](#declarative-tic-tac-toe) - Building through declarative programming and RSpec

# Hangman Gem
A simple commandline game

After learning about [declarative programming](https://vimeo.com/131588133) I wanted to try to apply this method to an entire project, from start to finish. A majority of this project was built using TDD and/or declarative programming concepts as best as they can be understood at an early exposure to the concept.
