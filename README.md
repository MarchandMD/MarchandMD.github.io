# Readme.md

Hello, and welcome to the public repo for my blog. This has been a repository for some of my learning exhaust as I've continued to learn and grow as a developer. It's been built from scratch (meaning I had no idea what Jekyll was before I started this project), as well as deployed for free on Github pages. I've had to learn a lot about various topics to deploy and maintain this site, and i'm looking forward to learning even more as I continue the journey.
