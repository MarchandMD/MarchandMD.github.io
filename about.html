      <p>As early as 2018 I was teaching myself to acquire programming languages, frameworks, logic and some computer science concepts.</p>
      <p>It started with "Learn to Program" by Christopher Pine.</p>
      <p>Eventually I enrolled in a 7 month full-time boot-camp, and I've refined that drive and commitment through Turing School of Software and Design.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.turing.edu">Turing School of Software and Design</a> aims to <span>unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high fulfillment technical careers.</span> And they are achieving their aim quite successfully.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in most new technologies and yes I have some preferences; My first priority <s>though is finding an employer who appreciates the work and investment I've made in myself, and can foster greater growth and development</s> is continuing to establish myself as a reliable, dedicated, empathetic, intelligent human who enjoys coding in my current role as a Staff Rails Engineer with DocMe360.</p>
      <p>I don't know how I got so lucky to be in the position I'm currently in, though I believe it may have to do with some combination of hard work, long hours at the library, the passage of time, and some [self-promotion I did on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mmarchand1_marchandmd-overview-activity-7083460492794494976-mKfx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).</p>
      <p><s>If that employer is you, then let's talkâ€¦</s> I'm not currently looking for any position, though if you really want to work with me, than ask me for references. I know many eager, qualified, motivated developers who are just as capable and dedicated as I am.</p>
      <p>If you're still curious, it's probably time to actually speak directly with me by scheduling a [:30 minute coffee chat]({% link coffee_chat.md %})</p>
