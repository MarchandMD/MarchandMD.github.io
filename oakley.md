## Tricks/Commands

- Sit
- Shake
- "Other one" (after "Shake")
- Kiss
- Down
  - while pointing to the ground
- Bang!
  - Make a finger gun....may have to "shoot" him multiple times
- Roll over
  - low success rate...best if said after Down and Bang!
- Spin!
  - Sometimes he confuses Roll over with Spin
- Up!Up!Up!
  - 3x all together; Say while pointing to a thing, and he'll jump up on the thing; car, rock, furniture...
- Under
  - He'll stick his head between your legs, from behind...expecting a treat
- OFF!
  - Said authoritatively....he'll stop jumping, or dismount any furniture/thing...use sparingly
- Go lay down!
  - If he's barking randomly and you want him to not do that; pair this with pointing in the general direction of his bed
