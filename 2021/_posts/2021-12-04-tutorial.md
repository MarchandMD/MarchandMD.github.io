so there's things I may want to do...but I don't know exacctly what I want to do. So just pick something. 

What would a new homepage look like? Is that even a good idea? 

What if I just want a page where I can put photos? Maybe that's something to do. 

I mean, I think more than anything, the most important part is getting content up onto the blog. 

But there are these other things I want to learn about. 

So, how would I add a page with photos? 

alright so what I want to do is, I want to somehow turn the page marked "blog" into a separate page, and I want to replace the home page with an actual home page..... so how will I do this? I mean, I need another one called index, then update the other one to blog. 

I'm definitely punching above my weight class; So what do I need to do? 

I mean, it's so easy to understand, but I don't realy know exacctly what I'm trying to achieve; so I need ot really articulate that. and I haven't done that all morning. 

So what do I really want to do? what am I trying to do?
