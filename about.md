# Hi!

<img style="float: right; margin: 1em;" src="/assets/images/me.png" width="50%" height="50%">

Over the course of the past several years I’ve taught myself to acquire programming languages, frameworks, logic and some computer science concepts.

Over the course of 7 months, I’ve refined that drive and commitment through Turing School of Software and Design.

#TuringSchoolOfSoftwareAndDesign aims to unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high fulfillment technical careers. And they are achieving their aim quite successfully.

I’m interested in most new technologies and yes I have some preferences; My first priority though is finding an employer who appreciates the work and investment I’ve made in myself, and can foster greater growth and development.

If that employer is you, then let’s talk…

If you're still curious, it's probably time to actually speak directly with me by scheduling a :30 minute coffee chat
