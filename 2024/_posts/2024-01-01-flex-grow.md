Ok, I need some way to write about this stuff because I learn more when I write.

Flex-grow.

the way I think about it is: I can use flex-grow on a div that's inside of another div that has the flex property.

does that make sense? I need a flex box before I can use flex-grow inside of it.

```html
<div id="outer_div">
  <div id="inner_div">
    hello world
  </div>
</div>
```

That's not an exact implementation of it, but it's the general idea. I think I still don't necessarily understand how it works.

```css
#outer_div {
  display: flex;
}

#inner_div {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

> This property (flex-grow) specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item (the flex grow factor).

So that's what the flex grow factor is.... the amount of remaining space IN THE FLEX CONTAINER.

Ok, here, this seems simple enough:

> flex-grow specifies how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container.

but this one is a little strange; because if I want to fill up a space, I can set the flex grow to be 1....

well, ok, now that I know how flex-grow is going to act....why wasn't it working in the tailwindcss?
